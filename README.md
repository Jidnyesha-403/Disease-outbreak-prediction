# Disease Outbreak Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and documentation for predicting disease outbreaks using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data, environmental factors, and socio-economic indicators, the project aims to develop predictive models to identify the likelihood and intensity of disease outbreaks in specific regions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize data, and engineer features relevant to disease outbreaks.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends, correlations, and spatial distributions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement various models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Prediction Visualization**: Display predictions on maps and charts for intuitive understanding.

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to set up the project and run the models on your system.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/disease-outbreak-prediction.git
cd disease-outbreak-prediction
```

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```
